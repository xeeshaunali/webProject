                The prevention of childhood dental caries relies on adherence to key behaviours, 
                including twice daily tooth brushing with fluoride toothpaste and reducing the 
                consumption of sugary foods and drinks. The aim of this qualitative study was 
                to explore parents’ perceptions of barriers and facilitators that influence these
                oral health behaviours in children. A further objective was to explore parents’ 
                views on limitations and opportunities for professional support to promote children’s
                oral health.

                Six focus group interviews were conducted, including a total of 39 parents of 7-year
                old children, who were recruited from paediatric dental centres in The Netherlands. 
                Interviews were held with Dutch parents of low and high socioeconomic status and parents
                from Turkish and Moroccan origin. Focus group interviews were conducted on the basis of
                a pre-tested semi-structured interview guide and topic list. Content analysis was employed
                to analyse the data.

            Good dental care begins before a baby's first tooth appears. Just because you can't
            see the teeth doesn't mean they aren't there. Teeth actually begin to form in the
            second trimester of pregnancy. At birth, your baby has 20 primary teeth, some of
            which are fully developed in the jaw.
